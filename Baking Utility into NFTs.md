# Baking Utility into NFTs
by [Christopher Robison](twitter.com/@cbobrobison) of [Hoard](twitter.com/@hoardexchange)

### Description
NFTs have been largely dominated by the 'collectable' community, which, of course, is awesome! But how do you develop utility for them beyond scarcity? Video games can teach us a lot about virtual economies and how to achieve NFT utility with a high probability of success.

Christopher Robison discusses how ERC721s - and other emerging standards, such as ERC998 - are fundamental building blocks for virtual economies and discusses how these might best be applied in ways which are familiar to video games, but new to blockchain.
